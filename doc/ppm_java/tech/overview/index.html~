                    <h1>Overview</h1>
                    <p>According to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_programme_meter">Article
                      on Wikipedia</a>, "a peak programme meter (PPM) is an instrument used in
                      professional audio for indicating the level of an audio signal." It is
                      different from a normal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VU_meter">VU
                      meter</a> in that it has a very short rise time (integration time) and a
                      long return time. This allows audio producers to continouusly monitor the peaks of a
                      programme signal.</p>
                    <p><code>ppm_java</code> implements a PPM type II which has a rise time of 23 dB in 10 ms
                          and a fall time of -24dB in 2800ms.</p>
                    <img src="sshot.png">
                    <p>Note that this application shows a debug window with various runtime statistics. This is 
                      because the application is a development concept, and it's handy to have that runtime
                      statistics visible. Also, due to some grafics issues with Java, when the debug window is 
                      not visible (resp. not being updated at high speed) we get a sluggish behaviour with the two
                      gauges on the PPM UI.<br>
                      Since the application is meant to be ported to C++/Qt5 later it's not that urgent to 
                      seek a solution to this graphics problem.</p>
