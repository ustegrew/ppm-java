/**
 * This interface defines an operation on audio data, expected to be a series of
 * float[] buffers that are contiguous elements of an audio data stream. The
 * initialize(float samplerate, int maxBufferSize) method should always be
 * called before either of the process... methods is called. An IllegalStateException
 * may be thrown if a process method is called without the Op being initialized.
 *
 * The reset() method should always be called in case of a break in the stream data.
 *
 * Implementors of this interface should specify whether they can process data in
 * place - ie. whether the input and output data sent to the process methods can
 * be the same. They should also specify the minimum and maximum number of input
 * and output channels they expect, and are free to throw Exceptions (eg.
 * ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) if the data is not arranged as expected.
